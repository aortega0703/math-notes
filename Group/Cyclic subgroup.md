---
For a [[Group]] $G$ and $a\in G$, $\langle a\rangle$ is a [[Subgroup]] of $G$. This is called the [[Cyclic group|cyclic subgroup]] of $G$ generated by $a$.
##### Proof:
By [[Subgroup criteria]] we only need to prove
- Non-emptiness:
	By definition $a\in \langle a \rangle$.
- Closed under $\cdot$:
	By definition $a^i, a^j, a^{i+j}\in \langle a \rangle$ for all $i,j\in \mathbb{Z}$ .
- Closed under inverses:
	By definition $a^i, a^-i \in \langle a \rangle$.
Therefore $\langle a\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$.
