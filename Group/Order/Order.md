Let $G$ be a [[Group]] and $g\in G$, then
- Of a group:
	The order of $G$ (denoted $|G|$) is the number of its elements. If $G\in \mathbb{N}$ it is a _finite group_.
- Of an element:
	The order of $g$ (denoted $|g|$) is the smallest $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $$g^n = e$$If no such $n$ exists, $g$ has _infinite order_.
