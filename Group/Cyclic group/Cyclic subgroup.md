For a [[Group]] $G$ and $a in G$, $\langle a\rangle$ is a [[Subgroup]] of $G$. This is called the [[Cyclic group|cyclic subgroup]] of $G$ generated by $a$.
##### Proof:
By [[Subgroup criteria]] we only need to prove
- Non-emptiness:
	By definition $a in \langle a \rangle$.
- Closed under $\cdot$:
	By definition $a^i, a^j, a^{i+j} in \langle a \rangle$ for all $i,j in  ZZ$ .
- Closed under inverses:
	By definition $a^i, a^-i  in \langle a \rangle$.
Therefore $\langle a\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$.
