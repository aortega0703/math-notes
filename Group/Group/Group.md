A _group_ is a [[Set]] $G$ with a [[Binary Operation]] $\cdot: G\times G\to G$ that has
- Associativity: for $a,b,c \in G$$$
	(ab)c = a(bc)$$
- Identity for $\cdot$ [^1]:a : for $a\in G$$$
	e\in F\quad s.t. \quad ea=ae=a$$
- Inverses for $\cdot$: for $a\in G$ $$a^{-1}\in F\quad s.t. \quad a^{-1}a=aa^{-1}=e$$

A group with a single element ($e$) is called a _trivial group_.

A _group_ is a [[Grupoid]] with a single object by [[Group is grupoid with 1 object]].
[^1]: The identity denoted by e after the German word _Einheit_ (identity).
