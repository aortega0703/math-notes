There are infinitely many primes.
##### Proof:
Suppose there is a list of all primes $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$. By [[Product +1 not divisible by its factors]] $n=p_1 p_2 \dots p_n + 1$ is not divisible by any prime $p_i<n$ so $n$ must be a prime. This is a contradiction as $n$ is not in the supposed list of all primes, therefore no such list exists.
