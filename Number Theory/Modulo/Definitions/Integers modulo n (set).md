By [[Congruence under modulo is equivalence relation]] and [[Equivalence relation iff partition]], the equivalence classes of [[Congruence under modulo|congruence mod n]] partitions $ ZZ$ into modulo classes. This partition is denoted $ ZZ/n ZZ$ or $ ZZ/n$, usually taken as only the representative elements ($0 lt.eq k < n$).
