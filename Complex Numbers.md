The set of _complex numbers_ ($CC$) is defined as:
$$
CC := {(a, b); space a,b in RR}
$$
with the operations (see [[#Notation]]):
- Addition:
$$
(a + b i) + (c + d i) = (a + b) + (c + d)i
$$
- Multiplication:
$$
(a + b i)(c + d i) = (a c - b d) + (a d + b c)i
$$
# Notation
The following are common notations for complex numbers (with $a, b in RR$ and $alpha, beta in CC$):
- $a + b i := (a, b) in CC$
- $a - b i := a + (-b)i$
- $a := a + 0 i$
- $b i := 0 + b i$
- $i := 0 + 1i$
- $alpha - beta := alpha + (-beta)$
