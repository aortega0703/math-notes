A _set_ is a collection of elements.
- Membership:
	Repetition and order do not matter in sets, only membership ("$s$ is an element of $S$" is denoted $s in S$). The set with no elements is called the _empty set_ (denoted by $\emptyset$), a set with a single element is called a _singleton_.
- Extensionality:
	Sets are uniquely characterized by their elements i.e. $A=B$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ have the same elements.
The notation for defining sets can be
- Extensional:
	The elements are enumerated e.g.$$
		\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}
	$$is the set whose elements are the integers from $1$ to $10$.
- Intensional:
	The elements are described by a property, and taken from a larger known set e.g.$$
		\{n in ZZ\ |\ 1 lt.eq n lt.eq 10\}
	$$is the set whose elements are the integers from $1$ to $10$.
- Ostensive:
	The elements are implied via examples e.g.$$
		\{1,2,\dots,9,10\}
	$$is the set whose elements are the integers from $1$ to $10$.
