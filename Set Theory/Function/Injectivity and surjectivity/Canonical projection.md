For a [[Set]] $S$ and an [[Equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on $S$, the _canonical projection_$$
\begin{align}
	[\cdot]: S &\twoheadrightarrow S/\!\!\sim\\
	s&\mapsto [s]
\end{align}
$$that sends an object to its equivalence class is [[Injectivity and surjectivity|Surjective]].
##### Proof:
By definition equivalence classes are non-empty, so for any equivalence class $e\in S/\!\sim$ there is some $s\in S$ such that $[s]=e$ making $[\cdot]$ surjective.
