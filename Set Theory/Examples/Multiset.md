A _multiset_ is similar to a [[Set]] in the sense that it does not track order, but it does track multiplicity[^1]. It can be defined as a function $n:S \to  ZZ$ that maps each element in the set $S$ to its multiplicity.
[^1]: e.g. multisets {1,2} and {1,2,2} are different because 2 appears a different number of times in both.
