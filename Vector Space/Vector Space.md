A vector space is a [[Set]] $V$ and a [[Field]] F with [[Binary Operation|Binary Operations]] $+: V times V -> V$ (addition) and $dot: F times V -> V$ (scalar multiplication) that has (for $u,v,w in V$ and $a,b in F$)
- Commutativity: $$u+v = v+u$$
- Associativity: $$
	
		(u + v) + w &= u + (v + w)\
		(a b)v &= a(b v)
	$$
- Distributivity: $$
	
		a(u+v) &= a u + a v\
		(a+b)v &= a v + b v
	$$
- Identities for $+,\cdot$: $$
 bold(0) in V  quad s.t. quad bold(0)+v = v\
1v=v
$$
- Inverses for $+$: $$
	
		-v  in V quad s.t.  quad -v + v = 0\
