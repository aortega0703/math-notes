- A [[Category|Morphism]] $f: B \to C$ is monic (often $f: B \hookrightarrow C$) when for all $g,h: A \to B$$$
	f \circ g= f \circ h \implies g=h

- A [[Category|Morphism]] $f: A \to B$ is epic (often $f: A \twoheadrightarrow B$) when for all $g,h: B \to C$, $$
	g \circ f = h \circ f \implies g=h

Monomorphisms and Epimorphisms are [[Opposite category|Dual]] concepts.
