A [[Category|Morphism]] $f: A -> B$ is an _isomorphism_ (often $f: A arrow.r.tilde B$) when there is some $f^{-1}: B -> A$ that is its two-sided [[Left-right inverse|inverse]], i.e.$$
	f^{-1}f=\operatorname{id}_A,\qquad f f^{-1}=\operatorname{id}_B
$$When there is an isomorphism $A arrow.r.tilde B$, it is said that $A$ is _isomorphic_ to $B$ (denoted $A\cong B$).
