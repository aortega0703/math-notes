For [[Abelian group|abelian groups]] $G,H$, their [[Direct product]] $G times H$ is also abelian. This means that $\mathbf{Ab}$ has products.
##### Proof:
Let $(g_1,h_1),\ (g_2,h_2) in G times H$, then$$

	(g_1,h_1)(g_2,h_2)
	&= (g_1 g_2, h_1 h_2)\
	&= (g_2 g_1, h_2 h_1)\
	&= (g_2, h_2)(g_1, h_1)

$$Then $G times H$ is abelian.
