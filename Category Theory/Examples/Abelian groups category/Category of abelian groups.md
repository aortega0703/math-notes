The [[Category]] of [[Abelian group|Abelian groups]] $\mathbf{Ab}$ is defined by
- $\text{Obj}(\mathbf{Ab})=$ the collection of Abelian groups.
- $\text{Hom}_\mathbf{Ab}(G,H)=$ the collection of [[Group homomorphism|group homomorphisms]] $G\to H$.
- $\circ=$ [[Function|Function composition]].

This data does describe a category.
##### Proof:
The morphisms and morphism composition is taken directly from $\mathbf{Grp}$, so the necessary axioms also apply for $\mathbf{Ab}$.
